\lhead{\emph{Introduction}}
$\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is the moduli stack (i.e. 2-scheme) of genus-$g$ curves over $\bQ$ with $n$ marked points. In his Sketch of a Program \cite{Grothendieck_1997} from 1983, Grothendieck proposes that we study $G_\bQ\defeq\mathrm{Gal}(\overline\bQ/\bQ)$ through its action on the Teichm\"uller Tower --- the collection of
\[\pi^{\mathrm{geom}}_1(\mathcal{M}_{g,n})\defeq\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}(\overline{\bQ}\times_{\bQ}\mathcal{M}_{g,n})\]
for all $g,n\in\bN$. Here, $\pi_1^{\mathrm{et}}$ takes the \'etale fundamental group, which is the inverse limit of the automorphism groups (analogous to the groups of deck transformations) of finite \'etale covers.

In genus-0, it is known that $\pi^{\mathrm{geom}}_1(\mathcal{M}_{0,4})\cong\widehat{\freegrp_2}$, the profinite completion of the free group on two generators. It follows from a theorem of Belyi's \cite{Belyi_1980} that $G_\bQ$ acts faithfully on $\pi^{\mathrm{geom}}_1(\mathcal{M}_{0,4})$, hence also $\lt\{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}\rt\}_n$. In \cite{Ihara_1991}, Ihara showed that the image of the action of $G_\bQ$ includes into the image of $\GThat$, the profinite completion of the inertia-preserving automorphisms of $\lt\{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}\rt\}_n$, i.e. the automorphisms $\phi$ such that on $\widehat{\freegrp_2}$, $\phi$ maps the procyclic subgroups $\lgl x\rgl,\lgl y\rgl,\lgl(xy)^{-1}\rgl$ to conjugate subgroups, where $x$ and $y$ are the generators of $\freegrp_2$ \cite{Lochak}.

In \cite{Drinfeld_1991}, Drinfeld constructs a pro-unipotent

version of $\GT$, and uses its action on braided monoidal categories (i.e. $\PaBhat$-algebras) to prove a result about quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebras.

In \cite{Petersen_2014}, Petersen uses the corresponding action on $\PaBhat$ to show that $E_2$ (the operad of little 2-disks) is formal.
