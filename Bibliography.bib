(One can regard these as essentially the AND/OR of traditional logic and the TIMES/PAR of (multiplicative) linear logic, respectively.) In the latter example, however, the distributivity one often finds is conspicuously absent: in this paper we study a “linearisation” of distributivity that is present in this context.

We establish this result by demonstrating that both GT and Gal_Q are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, thereby unveiling a unifying topological framework for their study. This identification enables a recursive encoding of Gal_Q via an explicit algorithm (the Cubic Matrioshka construction), that associates to each element of Gal_Q (and similarly to GT and its GT-shadows) a unique infinite binary sequence. Such a combinatorial parametrization provides a new computational approach to the structure of these fundamental groups. To recover the arithmetic content lost in the passage to topology, we introduce a novel invariant: the Galois Grothendieck Path Integral. Inspired by the Feynman Path Integral, this construction encapsulates deep arithmetic information through correlation functions, offering a new perspective on the interplay between Galois symmetries, deformation theory, and quantum structures.

In QLB-III, we introduced the Hopf algebra F(R)_z associated to a quantum R-matrix R(z) with a spectral parameter, and a set of points z=(z_1,...,z_n). This algebra is generated by entries of a matrix power series T_i(u), i=1,...,n,subject to Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan type commutation relations, and is a quantization of the group GL_N[[t]]. In this paper we consider the quotient F_0(R)_z of F(R)_z by the relations qdet_R(T_i)=1, where qdet_R is the quantum determinant associated to R (for rational, trigonometric, or elliptic R-matrices). This is also a Hopf algebra, which is a quantization of the group SL_N[[t]]. This paper was inspired by the pioneering paper of I.Frenkel and Reshetikhin.

Briefly, an operad is a device that encodes a category of algebras, such as associative algebras, commutative algebras, Lie algebras, and so on. In topology, they were introduced in the study of iterated loop spaces, which have a structure encoded by a certain class of operad, the little disks operads. These operads are central to the theory and appear in many applications.}, booktitle={Real Homotopy of Configuration Spaces: Peccot Lecture, Collège de France, March \& May 2020}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Idrissi, Najib}, editor={Idrissi, Najib}, year={2022}, pages={127-172}, language={en} }

 @article{Kontsevich, title={Operads and Motives in Deformation Quantization}, abstractNote={The algebraic world of associative algebras has many deep connections with the geometric world of two-dimensional surfaces. Recently, D. Tamarkin discovered that the operad of chains of the little discs operad is formal, i.e. it is homotopy equivalent to its cohomology. From this fact and from Deligne’s conjecture on Hochschild complexes follows almost immediately my formality result in deformation quantization. I review the situation as it looks now. Also I conjecture that the motivic Galois group acts on deformation quantizations, and speculate on possible relations of higher-dimensional algebras and of motives to quantum ¢eld theories.}, author={Kontsevich, Maxim}, language={en} }

This approach, naturally arising in string theory, leads us to consider various versions of models. Besides of some applications in topology and homological algebra we show that our theory enables one to prove the existence of homotopy structures on physically relevant spaces. For example, we prove that a closed string-field theory induces a homotopy Lie algebra structure on the space of relative states, which is one of main results of T. Kimura, A. Voronov and J. Stasheff (see [16]). Our theory gives a systematic way to prove statements of this type.

The cyclicity is appropriately treated in a coherent way, i.e. up to coherent isomorphism. When the symmetric monoidal bicategory is specified to be a certain symmetric monoidal bicategory of linear categories subject to finiteness conditions, we prove that cyclic associative and cyclic framed little 2-disks algebras, respectively, are equivalent to pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier categories, a type of category that was introduced by Boyarchenko-Drinfeld based on Barr’s notion of a $star$-autonomous category. We use these results and Costello’s modular envelope construction to obtain two applications to quantum topology: I) We extract a consistent system of handlebody group representations from any ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier category inside a certain symmetric monoidal bicategory of linear categories and show that this generalizes the handlebody part of Lyubashenko’s mapping class group representations. II) We establish a Grothendieck-Verdier duality for the category extracted from a modular functor by evaluation on the circle (without any assumption on semisimplicity), thereby generalizing results of Tillmann and Bakalov-Kirillov.}, note={arXiv:2010.10229 [math]}, number={arXiv:2010.10229}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Müller, Lukas and Woike, Lukas}, year={2022}, month=jun }

An algebra over the cohomology of this operad is the same thing as a G-equivariant CohFT, as defined by Jarvis, Kaufmann and Kimura.

A group operad is a planar operad with an action operad equivariant structure. In the first three parts of this monograph, we establish a foundation for group operads and for their higher coherent analogues called infinity group operads. Examples include planar, symmetric, braided, ribbon, and cactus operads, and their infinity analogues. For example, with the tools developed here, we observe that the coherent ribbon nerve of the universal cover of the framed little 2-disc operad is an infinity ribbon operad. In Part 4 we define general monoidal categories equipped with an action operad equivariant structure, and provide a unifying treatment of coherence and strictification for them. Examples of such monoidal categories include symmetric, braided, ribbon, and coboundary monoidal categories, which naturally arise in the representation theory of quantum groups and of coboundary Hopf algebras and in the theory of crystals of finite dimensional complex reductive Lie algebras. Many illustrations and examples are included. Assuming only basic category theory, this monograph is intended for graduate students and researchers.
